Too many unwritten stories today,

too many unfinished.

Some missing the commas, and others needing a full stop.

Too many felt sad because they couldn’t find 
completeness,

others were happy because they couldn’t.

I asked one story why are you so happy today?

What are you looking for?

I think my beauty is in being incomplete.

All I need is someone with imagination, said the story.

And then I looked up and stared a little longer,

It was just the mirror,

that story, was me.
