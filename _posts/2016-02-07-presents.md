I gave her a box of chocolates,

Silky, melty browns

I gave her a teddy bear and a toy car

Blue and red

I gave her a dress

Green, like the emerald trees

I gave her a souvenir

Gold and clunky metal

I gave her memories

Of us, of me, of her in tees

I gave her a dream

One she could live in

I gave her treasures

Tangible and otherwise,

I gave her my days

And I gave her nights

I gave her all of me;

All she gave me,

Was a look.
