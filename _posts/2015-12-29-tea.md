She has the warmth of tea

And aroma from north eastern parts of country we called India

She could make my day every day

Her being empty gave me hope

And being full pleasure

"You should have changed her years ago

When she had cracks in her" they said

Little did they know

These cracks in her gave me a new way to sip life

Every day.

Maybe its my love for the cup of tea

But maybeâ€š just maybe

Its for her who makes it for me
