title: Because I told you so by Susan Ryan
---
No, mother

I'm not going to look down pretending to be shy

I'm not going to stop picking my nose

I will not hope for a good husband

Or do a ritual that assures his well-being

He is allowed to do whatever he wants

Smoke himself to death or even commit suicide

I will not listen to you, because you barely hear me out

Forget returning the favor .

I will not carry you forward

When you are hell bent on executing- backward ideas in a unidirectional world

Heading towards absolute chaos.

I'd like to believe, chaos is relative

I will not sketch leaves when I could draw

Bare men bearing women inside them

Singing in voices that are worthy of my bold black strokes

On pristine pink canvases.

I am not going to be careful

Because it does not make me feel carefree

I will not ask for forgiveness,

I may undo actions but I shall never undo thoughts

I will not be a good girl because I'm supposed to,

I might try my hand at goodwill because. Just, because.

I will not stop tattooing my body, I will be his canvas

The needles hurt me far less than the words you injected into my system

And the ink is far less permanent than the pain I have learnt to live with

I will not exercise moderation because my extremity offends your neighbor,

I will err, as much as I can and much, much more if I have to

Because it teaches me lessons far more valuable than 'Behave'

I will not be available for viewing like dead pieces in a gallery

I will be the art, the artist hides in his underwear drawer behind a bra

I will be reckless and love people more than I should

More than necessary for my own good

I will fly knowing I'm not aerodynamically designed.

I will work more nights than days, in unimaginable ways

I will be the man of the world, the woman in a herd

I will choose to live better than my own yesterday

I'm going to look at the bright, beautiful stars and celebrate me
