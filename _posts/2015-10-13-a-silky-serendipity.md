title: A Silky Serendipity
---
I fell in love again today

She was as beautiful as her name, Silky.

She came close and felt my aura.

I could tell she liked me.

I could sense the smile on her face.

Her eyes were deep blue, her teeth shiny under the starry skies

She moved towards me so gracefully

With a gentle touch she told me she loved me

I knew she said the truth, how could i not know?

Her body conveyed that to me in ways no one ever will, no one ever could

She did not have any questions for me

Who I was? Where did I come from? Where would I go after?

I could tell she didn’t care, she did not come with biases or preconceived notions

She somehow knew exactly how i felt.

And I, she. I bet no one would have imagined she would fall for me.

But she did.

Some may call it an accident but I knew it was Serendipity.

She somehow already knew about my wounds, my angels and my demons.

I knew it was love. She healed me.

I don’t know if I will ever see her again,

but here is what i do know‚

her paw prints would be on my heart, forever.
