Under the starry sky,
the cool breeze across my soul,
writing about the things I love
and the moon is peaking from above,
It says peek-a-boo.


Looks like it came running to listen to some stories,
or see them come to life on this screen.
It forgot the other half somewhere.
I have more stories to tell today.
Ones from the past, and the future alike.


Join me if you can tonight,
let's fall in love with stories, more of them,
stars, them all, will show us the way
I couldn't have been in a better place
I am home, and you are welcome.
