<p>She stayed away from the brightness</p>
<p>The sun and the lights</p>
<p>Everyone though she was dull and dumb</p>
<p>She liked the dark they said.</p>
<p>Little did they know she was burning inside.</p>
<p>You had to wait for the sun to go away</p>
<p>And look at her again</p>
<p>She was a firefly</p>
