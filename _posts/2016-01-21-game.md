They gambled in millions

With expensive glasses of spirits 

And coins that had a worth only indoors

They needed luck to make more.

But they lost.

I gambled in silence

With ideas as my stash

And my favorite drink?

Hope on the rocks.

Reality made the rocks tough and cold

But hope had a high second to none.

Every time I lost?

My hope doubled.

I was a winner both ways.

Always.
