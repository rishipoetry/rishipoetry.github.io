"What was the most beautiful thing about her absence?"

"The scent of her

that followed her to the gate

but refused to leave me.

It was the greatest gift her soul left me with.

I weaved that into the roses I grew.

Now every rose reminds me of the love

not of love that was,

but the meaning, beauty and the fragrance of love,

and every thorn, of reality.

Sometimes I purposefully puncture my fingers on them,

that drop of blood reminds me

how similar we are."
