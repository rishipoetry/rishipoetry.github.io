The wrinkled face might deceive you,

but only her eyes reveal her age.

She was worrying about her image.

Looks mattered more than substance

She should have been worrying about broken knees

and scratched hands, broken sandcastles

and cycling accidents.

She worries about getting out of the house

and more so about getting back in time

She was born an explorer, but now

she is only a captive in time.

What have we done to our daughters?

She is just 15.
