Kurta, a jute side-bag

Pyjamas making him feel comfy under the deadlocks

Sparks in the mind

dreams in the eyes

and a fire in the belly

He was a rockstar today

A writer, director, an actor too,


But just yesterday he wore a pants and shirt,

had no hair or ambition,

or so it looked.

His hands still smelled of ink

and the pen always had a rhyme.


The mightiest of stars

hide in the plain sight

fingers typing the brackets and the commas,

behind the large blue black screens,

doing day in day out, the things

that keeps us all going.

If only we looked beyond what we see

You would find him. Really.

Look, there is the Sun!
